        <h1>Design Project</h1>
        <h4>Fall 2019</h4>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p>This project was oriented around giving members of Codeology a crash course through the design process,specifically in the tech field. A lot inspiration from the project was taken from the CS design course provided by Berkeley itself (CS 160) as well as bits and pieces from decals hosted by other clubs on campus like <a href="https://berkeleyinnovation.org/">Berkeley Innovation</a> and the <a href="https://wdd.io/">website design decal</a>.</p>
        <p>I chose to do this project in particular because many CS/EECS students don't ever get an exposure to design, despite it being (in my opinion), a critical component of the CS industry,especially at the startup level. Often times, though, this is simply due to the lack of resources. Even with all the resources I listed above that students can use in order to learn about design, very few students are accepted into those classes, leading to a significant lack of exposure. This effect is further compounded by the fact that many students often think of design secondary to other aspects of CS (e.g. learning about backend material, ML or data science as they're picking up in popularity). However, I think that anybody can learn how to become a decent designer, given just a little time and work in the field.</p>
