        <p>Disclaimer: Since I ended up making this website in June 2019, it seemed kind of hard to keep a calendar-like tracking system of 
            my thoughts, life, or whatever else I put on the blog due to, well, the past being kind of a long time ago and all that.
            However, I also wanted to use the timline to experiment with my website (and hopefully it'll continue into the future), so
            I wanted to include my first couple of college years, which were really important to me.  As a result, I decided to dedicate
            the 2017 and 2018 pages to being more of a summary of those years.
        </p>

        <p>Originally I wrote this entire post without talking about the first half of my freshman year or any of my high school career
            but after writing a lot of it (and in retrospect), I think a lot of that time changed the person I would eventually become, so
            a lot of this post include my time in 2016. I think a large reason that that's the case is because I think I genuinely enjoyed
            high school to the point that I enjoy reminiscing about it. A lot of the friends and people I talk to in college have expressed
            that their high school, in some way or another, was not that enjoyable, especially in comparison to their experiences in college.
        </p>
        <p>In that first semester of college though, the only thing I wished for was to go back to something as simple as my senior year in 
            high school. A lot of my expectations for college, for better or for worse, were based off what a lot people see in movies and TV
            shows.
