            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi there! If you haven't met me before, my name is Ayush Maganahalli and I'm currently studying at UC Berkeley, where I'm double majoring in Electrical
                Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and Applied Mathematics. This past summer, I taught Berkeley's Machine Architecture class as the Head Teaching Assistant.</p>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in San Ramon, California and came to Berkeley after I graduated from Dougherty Valley High, so you can really see that I expanded my horizons by going to college 30 minutes away. When I came to Berekley, I had planned to become a bioengineer but over the course of taking a couple CS classes and <i>one</i> Organic Chem course, I realized that my path lay in the direction of CS (or basically any field that didn't involve OChem).
            </p>
            <h2>Clubs</h2>
            <!-- <h3>College</h3> -->
            <div class="club-paragraph">
                <p class="club-blurb">Since I came to college, I've been part of <a href="https://badminton.berkeley.edu/">Cal Badminton</a>. I chose to join purely out of curiousity, having seen the sport played competitively for the first time in my life while watching the Rio Olympics. CalBad has been a huge part of my experience at Berkeley, being the first club I joined on campus and always providing a place for community. I eventually became president of the club, continuing to grow and enrich the community that had given so much to me. I'm hoping that, somewhere down the line, I'll be able to contribute to the badminton community at large in the US and abroad.</p>

            <br>
            <div class="club-paragraph" id="cs">
                <p class="club-blurb">Outside of badminton, I'm part of some CS clubs on campus, one of which is <a href="https://www.berkeleyanova.org/">Anova</a>. ANova focuses on providing CS education and access to under-resourced communities around the Bay Area, hoping to deconstruct issues like income or gender inequality present in the tech industry. This past semester I was stationed at Downtown Charter Academy, a middle school in Oakland. My team and I introduced them to Snap and Python, teaching basic concepts like if/else statements and for loops.</p>

            <div class="club-paragraph" id="cs">
                <p class="club-blurb">Similarly, I'm also part of another CS club on campus, <a href="https://www.codeology.club/">Codeology</a>, which aims to provide a CS community for many people who are new to CS or are unfamiliar with aspects of the CS community like internship preparation. I've served as a Project Leader for a design-based project and the Director of Education, which is primarily focused on teaching newer members about how to succeed at SWE interviews.</p>

            <br>
            <div class="club-paragraph">
                <p class="club-blurb">Interestingly, I'm also part of <a href="https://ethicalapparel.org/">EthiCAL</a>, a clothing club on campus, which, given my lack of fashion, I didn't think I would've been part of prior to joining. EthiCAL uses the apparel it makes as a fundraiser to provide resources around the Bay and the world for various causes. This semester, the club decided to focus on water conversation and human labor rights, while also doing what we can to help provide a foundation for local entrepreneurs who could use the funding. Organizations we've partnered up with include Save the Bay, Society of Women Engineers @ Berkeley, and many others. We've donated thousands of dollars to people and organizations around the world, and hope to continue to do so for many years to come!</p>

            <!-- <h3>High School</h3>
                <div class="club-paragraph">
                    <p class="club-blurb">In high school, I was heavily involved in Speech and Debate, where I competed in Varsity Lincoln-Douglass on the national circuit. I started my career in LD, succeeding at the local level in novice and JV levels, and eventually transferred to circuit LD in my junior and senior years. I participated in multiple national tournaments, breaking at a handful, with our team finally mading it to the Tournament of Champions for the first time my senior year. I've also participated in Policy, Parli, and PuFo, and have reached Quarterfinals of the California State Tournament as well as Quarterfinals of the National World Schools Tournament.</p>

                <div class="club-paragraph">
                    <p class="club-blurb">Since I was in elementary school, I participated in FIRST robotics tournaments. I started in FLL and transitioned into FTC while in high school. FLL gave me an introduction into many of topics and causes that I'm passionate about today like global warming, healthcare, and others. It served as a launching pad for me becoming an engineer and also learning to love the competitive teamwork aspects of many fields, whether that be sports, tech, or academics.</p>
